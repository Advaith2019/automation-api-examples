# Pulumi Via Jupyter

This project explores running Pulumi through a Jupyter Notebook.

To run this example you'll need a few pre-reqs:
1. A Pulumi CLI installation ([v2.10.1](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/versions/) or later)
2. The AWS CLI, with appropriate credentials.

First, set up your virtual environment:
1. ```shell
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   ```
2. ```shell
   $ venv/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
3. ```shell
   $ venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Then, start up the notebook server with `venv/bin/jupyter notebook`.
